## What is rAthena Server Monitor
The rAthena Server Monitor is a Windows desktop application built with WPF (.NET Framework 4.8.1) that provides real-time monitoring and control for rAthena game servers. It manages four distinct server processes (Login, Character, Map, and Web servers), capturing their console output, parsing log messages, and presenting categorized information through a graphical interface.

## Primary Capabilities:
- Launch and terminate rAthena server executables
- Capture and display real-time stdout/stderr output from each server
- Categorize log messages by type (Error, Warning, Debug, SQL, Status, Users)
- Track key metrics (online players, error counts, warning counts)
- Provide background monitoring via system tray integration
- Export error logs for analysis
